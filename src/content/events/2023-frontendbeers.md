Running checks in a continuous integration system doesn’t mean there’s nothing left to improve in our product. But at least, what can be detected by the machine can be quickly fixed, allowing us to focus on other issues.

At Axa, a few months ago, we launched an initiative to ensure no regression on certain sustainable digital metrics (Accessibility and Green IT).

In this talk, we will present our complete approach: from our first steps in analyzing our applications to our current solution, the tools we use, and the components we rely on (Lighthouse, Puppeteer, EcoIndex, …).

We are also considering open-sourcing our solution so that it can be used in your own projects.
