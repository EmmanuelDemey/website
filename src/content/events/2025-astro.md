Websites evolve, and so do technologies. But what if WordPress, the historic leader of CMS, no longer meets modern requirements for performance and flexibility? That’s the challenge we tackled by migrating the website of Vaduo Consulting to Astro, a revolutionary framework built for a faster and more optimized web.

In this talk, we’ll share:

✅ Our technology choices and why Astro quickly became the obvious solution.

✅ The challenges of migrating the Vaduo Consulting website and the solutions we implemented.

✅ The strengths of Astro in 2025: islands architecture, hybrid SSR/SSG, boosted performance, and much more.

Whether you’re a developer, a CTO, or simply curious about web trends, this session will give you hands-on feedback and insights to help you consider Astro for your upcoming projects.
