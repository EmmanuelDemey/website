Elasticsearch has long been a powerful tool for searching, aggregating, and analyzing data at scale. With the introduction of ES|QL (Elasticsearch Query Language), a new chapter begins. ES|QL brings a unified, SQL-inspired syntax designed not only for search but also for advanced data transformations, making it easier than ever to query, enrich, and correlate data directly within Elasticsearch.

In this session, we will explore the motivations behind ES|QL, its syntax, and its key features compared to existing query approaches. Through practical examples, we will demonstrate how ES|QL simplifies common tasks such as filtering, aggregations, joins, and time-series analysis, while also opening the door to more complex data pipelines natively in Elasticsearch.

Whether you are a developer, data analyst, or architect, you will leave this talk with a clear understanding of how ES|QL can streamline your workflows and unlock new possibilities for interacting with your Elasticsearch data.
