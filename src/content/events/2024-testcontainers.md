Testcontainers is an increasingly popular solution for interacting with Docker images in development or testing environments.

In this talk, Quentin and Emmanuel will run a live coding session demonstrating how to integrate this solution into a Spring Boot application. Come and discover how simple it is to get started with this technology — and why not start using it the very next day in your company or with your client?
