We are all users of websites or web applications. But are we all equal when it comes to accessing this information? Do we all use our web browser in the same way? Of course not.

Whether it’s the inability to navigate a site or to understand it, we have all faced — or could face — problems while browsing our favorite websites.

In this talk, we will explore the challenges of accessibility in web application development. From semantics in your HTML code to focus management in complex rich components, you will leave with a complete overview of the issues to consider for your next application.
